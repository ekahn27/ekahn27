Hello! My name is Eric and I am currently a student at Cornell University
studying Electrical & Computer Engineering as well as Computer Science.

This is my personal github where I house some of my projects, my preferences for
linux and vim, and some smaller code that's just for fun. You can also check out
[this site](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2020/edk52-jpp242/)
to see one of the projects from my embedded systems class.

See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Eric-Kahn/) to learn more about
me.
