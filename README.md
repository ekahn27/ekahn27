Hello! My name is Eric and I am currently a student at Cornell University
studying Electrical & Computer Engineering as well as Computer Science.

This is my personal github where I house my personal projects for just fun
things I'm messing around with. You can also check out my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Eric-Kahn/) to learn more about me.

You can also check out [this
site](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2020/edk52-jpp242/)
to see one of the projects from my embedded systems class.
